# ARCC
ARCC - Allowable Revocable Contract Chain System for Bitcoin Cash

ARCC allows the payer to take back the money while still allowing the payee to withdraw some funds from the contract based on restrictions of time and amount.

There can be a range of applications/mechanisms possible including but not limited to, Streaming Services, Pay as you use, Recurring payments, Milestone based payouts, Project funding, Pocket money etc.

```solidity
pragma cashscript ^0.6.3;

/**
 * @param: payerPk: Pubkey of the payer.
 * @param: payeePk: Pubkey of the payee.
 * @param: epoch: Each epoch represents a timeframe, epoch = 1 is 1 block.
 * @param: maxAmountPerEpoch: Max amount allowed to be spend by payee per epoch.
 * @param: remainingTime: The remaining time after which a new epoch will start.
 * @param: remaningAmount: Remaining amount that can be withdrawan from the contract by payee before next epoch starts.
 * @param: validFrom: The blockheight/time of contract/state creation.
 *
 * - Expected improvements in near future.
 * 1. I recently received a suggestion from bitjson regarding privacy.
    I am thinking of adding a contract deadline in the ARCC itself. For me to explore more on this idea.
    I think I need to spend some time on 3 cases. (There may be more cases though and suggestions are welcome.)

    1. Accumulation: If I add a deadline when implementing an accumulation strategy in the contract then the number of epochs passed would matter.
    2. Non-Accumulation: If a deadline only accounts for only those epochs where at least 1 transaction was done, then it can simply keep a track of the epochs passed just like it keeps a track of the remaining amount. (i.e a reversed counter)
    3. Hard deadline: Expiration after a block-height, payee won‚Äôt be able to pull any funds from the contract after that.
 *
 * 2. A way to perform accumulation but have a signal(bool) to notify whether this contract supports it or
    not or the contract should be able to signal that some epochs have remaining funds. That would be cool! :D
 *
 * These changes or any different version of the contract will be available in the contracts folder of the root directory.
